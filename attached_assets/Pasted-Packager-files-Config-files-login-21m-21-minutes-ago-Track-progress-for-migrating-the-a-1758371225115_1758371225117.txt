Track progress for migrating the agent import process

4 messages & 13 actions
I'll help you migrate your project from Replit Agent to the Replit environment. This migration is essential for Replit compatibility, safety, and security, ensuring proper client/server separation and robust security practices. Let me start by examining your project structure and checking the workflow logs to understand what needs to be fixed.

Add advertisements to various pages to promote services
When adding major new functionality, consider starting a fresh Agent conversation to avoid context overload. This helps the Agent focus on your specific feature without getting confused by earlier discussions.
Can you see the MoveIt Courier ads displayed on the pages? Are they appearing properly throughout the site?

Create a reward system for a book donation platform where donors earn stars based on confirmed book requests. The logic is as follows:
• When a donated book is requested and confirmed by a recipient, the donor earns 1 star.
• Stars accumulate and unlock rewards based on the following thresholds:
• 4 stars → Reward: China Aster seedlings
• 10 stars → Reward: Yellow Chrysanthemum seedlings
• 15 stars → Reward: Hybrid Marigold seedlings
• 20 stars → Reward: Petunia seedlings
• 50 stars or more → Reward: Premium hybrid flower varieties, including Climbing Rose, 10 o'clock flowers, and other rare type
Put this in a catchy beautiful way in the edit profile section….Ensure that the rating system is working well…

I'll help you create proper catchy advertisement designs and implement the reward system for your book donation platform. Let me start by updating the advertisements and adding the reward system to the profile section.
Use the visual editor to select any element to give the Agent specific context, or make changes directly in the preview pane for instant results.
Can you see the new catchy text-based ads for MoveIt Courier and GetGreen Nursery? Also, check your profile page - do you see the beautiful Green Rewards Program with the plant seedling rewards?
